    """Measure a Gaussian-weighted average of an image.

    This function is meant to be used with images that represent the fraction
    of single-epoch images that are masked in each pixel of a coadd. It
    computes a Gaussian-weighted average of the image at a list of locations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mfrac : np.ndarray
        The input image with which to compute the weighted averages.
    x : np.ndarray
        The input x/col values for the positions at which to compute the
        weighted average.
    y : np.ndarray
        The input y/row values for the positions at which to compute the
        weighted average.
    box_sizes : np.ndarray
        The size of the stamp to use to measure the weighted average. Should be
        big enough to hold 2 * `fwhm`.
    obs : ngmix.Observation
        An observation that holds the weight maps, WCS Jacobian, etc
        corresponding to `mfrac`.
    fwhm : float or None
        The FWHM of the Gaussian aperture in arcseconds. If None, a default
        of 1.2 is used.

    Returns
    -------
    mfracs : np.ndarray
        The weighted averages at each input location.
